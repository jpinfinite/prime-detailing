If you are reading this, there is a 90% chance that you or someone you know has already committed this devastating mistake during polishing. And the worst part: many don't realize it until it's too late.

## The Mistake No One Tells You

After training hundreds of professionals and correcting countless damaged paint jobs, I can state with certainty: **the number 1 mistake in polishing is not the technique, nor the product — it is inadequate surface preparation**.

### Why Does This Happen?

The anxiety to see the shine makes 9 out of 10 people skip the most critical step: complete decontamination. They see the paint "clean" after washing and go straight to the polisher.

**The result?** Micro-particles of contaminants are dragged by the pad at high rotation, creating circular scratches (holograms) that are even worse than the original defects.

## The Real Consequence

See what happens when you skip decontamination:

1. **Invisible contaminants** (tar, industrial fallout, overspray) remain stuck to the paint
2. The **pad captures these particles** during polishing
3. These particles act like **microscopic sandpaper** at high speed
4. Result: **deep holograms** that require additional correction

### The Cost of the Mistake

- **Lost time:** 2-3 extra hours of rework
- **Wasted product:** Up to 40% more compound needed
- **Paint wear:** Unnecessary removal of an additional layer
- **Financial cost:** $50-100 in professional rework

## How to Avoid It (The Right Way)

### Step 1: Plastic Bag Test

After washing, pass a clean plastic bag over the paint. If you feel roughness, there is contamination.

### Step 2: Chemical Decontamination

```
1. Apply clay lube or quick detailer
2. Use clay bar in linear movements
3. Work panel by panel
4. Clean the clay bar constantly
```

### Step 3: Inspection with Light

Use a strong LED flashlight at a 45° angle to identify:
- Existing micro-scratches
- Holograms from previous polishing
- Areas of higher contamination

### Step 4: Final Cleaning

Before polishing, clean with IPA (isopropyl alcohol 50/50) to remove:
- Old wax residues
- Clay bar oils
- Any previous protective film

## Other Critical Mistakes (Bonus)

### 2. Excessive Pressure on the Polisher

**Mistake:** Forcing the machine against the paint
**Correct:** Let the weight of the polisher do the work

### 3. Dirty or Saturated Pad

**Mistake:** Using the same pad for hours
**Correct:** Clean every 2-3 panels and change when saturated

### 4. Insufficient Product

**Mistake:** Skimping on polishing compound
**Correct:** 4-5 pea-sized drops per panel

### 5. Inadequate Speed

**Mistake:** Maximum rotation all the time
**Correct:** Start at medium speed (3-4) and adjust as necessary

## Checklist Before Polishing

Use this list to ensure zero errors:

- [ ] Car washed with neutral shampoo
- [ ] Decontamination with complete clay bar
- [ ] Plastic bag test passed
- [ ] Surface completely dry
- [ ] IPA cleaning performed
- [ ] Pads clean and in good condition
- [ ] Correct product for the type of defect
- [ ] Adequate lighting for inspection
- [ ] Masking tape on rubber and plastics
- [ ] Work area covered and ventilated

## Pro Tip

**Invest 30 minutes in preparation to save 3 hours of correction.**

The best detailers I know spend 40% of the total service time just on preparation. Polishing itself is fast when the surface is correctly prepared.

## Recommended Products for Decontamination

### Basic ($30-40)
- Traditional clay bar
- Quick detailer as lubricant
- Quality microfiber

### Intermediate ($60-80)
- Clay mitt (more durable)
- Specific clay lube
- Iron remover

### Professional ($120-150)
- Nanoskin AutoScrub
- Premium iron remover
- LED light inspection system

## FAQ

**Can I skip the clay bar if the car is new?**
No. New cars accumulate contamination in the dealer's lot and during transport.

**How often should I decontaminate?**
Every polishing, without exception. Between polishings, every 3-6 months depending on use.

**Does clay bar scratch the paint?**
No, if used correctly with adequate lubrication. The risk comes from using dirty clay or without lubricant.

**Can I use detergent as a lubricant?**
Never. Use only specific products (clay lube or quick detailer).

## Conclusion

The mistake that ruins 90% of polishings lies not in the polishing technique, but in what you do (or fail to do) before turning on the polisher.

**Remember:** Inadequate preparation = Inadequate result

Invest time in decontamination and you will have:
- Less polishing time
- Better final result
- Greater durability of the work
- Product savings
- Paint preservation

**Next time you go to polish, ask yourself:** "Did I really prepare the surface or just wash the car?"

The honest answer to this question determines whether you will have a professional result or another frustrating rework.
