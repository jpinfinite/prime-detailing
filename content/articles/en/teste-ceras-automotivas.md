- **Exposure:** 8h/day in sun, natural rain, weekly washes

### Evaluated Criteria (Score 0-10)
1. **Ease of application** (time and effort)
2. **Initial shine** (measured with gloss meter)
3. **Durability** (weeks of effective protection)
4. **Water repellency** (contact angle)

*Not a wax, it's a glaze

## What We Learned

### 1. Price Is Not Everything
Vonixx Vintage ($18) beat more expensive and cheaper products. The secret is in the formulation, not marketing.

### 2. Carnaubat vs. Synthetic
- **Carnauba:** More "wet" and deep shine
- **Synthetic:** Superior durability (2-3x more)

### 3. Real vs. Promised Durability
No wax lasted what it promised on the packaging. The average was 60-70% of the announced time.

### 4. Application Matters
Even the best waxes failed when applied incorrectly:
- Hot surface = stains
- Thick layer = difficult removal
- No prep = reduced durability

## Final Recommendations

### For Beginners
**Vonixx Vintage** - Easy to use, guaranteed result

### For Durability
**Meguiar's NXT** - Apply and forget for 3 months

### For Tight Budget
**Vonixx Blend** - Best value for money (almost approved)

### To Avoid
**Autoshine Carnaúba** - False economy, you will spend more

## Tips to Maximize Any Wax

1. **Prepare the surface:** Wash + decontaminate + dry
2. **Apply in thin layers:** Less is more
3. **Work in the shade:** Ideal temperature: 15-25°C
4. **Wait for the right time:** Until it hazes (not completely dry)
5. **Remove with clean microfiber:** Use different towels to apply and remove

## FAQ

**Can I mix different waxes?**
Not recommended. Each formulation has its own chemistry that may react badly.

**Liquid vs. paste wax?**
Paste usually has more carnauba and lasts longer. Liquid is easier to apply.

**Do I need to polish before waxing?**
Not mandatory, but the shine will be 50-70% better with prior polishing.

**How many layers to apply?**
2 thin layers > 1 thick layer. More than 2 is waste.

## Conclusion

After 3 months, $180 spent and hundreds of hours of testing, the conclusion is clear:

**Only 2 of the 7 best-selling waxes really are worth the investment.**

If you want professional results:
- **Maximum shine:** Vonixx Vintage
- **Maximum durability:** Meguiar's NXT

The other 5? Save your money and time.
