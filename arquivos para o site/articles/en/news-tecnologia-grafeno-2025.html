            <h2>What is Graphene?</h2>
            <p>Graphene is a form of carbon organized in a single-layer hexagonal structure, just one atom thick. Discovered in 2004 (winning the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010), it is considered to be the strongest material ever tested - 200 times stronger than steel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Extraordinary properties:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extreme mechanical strength</li>
                <li>Superior thermal conductivity</li>
                <li>Molecular flexibility</li>
                <li>Natural hydrophobicity</li>
                <li>Exceptional chemical resistance</li>
                <li>Optical transparency</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Graphene vs Traditional Ceramic Coating</h2>
            
            <h3>Ceramic Coating (SiO2)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base:</strong> Silicon dioxide</li>
                <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> 9H</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> 2-5 years</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal resistance:</strong> Up to 500°C</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrophobicity:</strong> 110-115°</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Graphene Coating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base:</strong> Graphene + SiO2</li>
                <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> 10H+</li>
                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> 5-10 years</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal resistance:</strong> Up to 1000°C</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrophobicity:</strong> 115-120°</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="article-tip">
                <h3>💡 Key Difference</h3>
                <p>Graphene does not replace SiO2, but complements it. Most graphene coatings are actually hybrids: SiO2 + graphene, combining the best of both worlds.</p>

            <h2>Is it worth the investment?</h2>
            
            <h3>When Graphene Makes Sense</h3>
            <p><strong>✅ Recommended if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have hard water in your area (frequent water spots)</li>
                <li>Your car is constantly exposed to the sun</li>
                <li>You want maximum durability (5-10 years)</li>
                <li>Budget allows (R$3,000-6,000)</li>
                <li>New or recently repaired car</li>
                <li>You want the most advanced technology</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When Traditional Ceramic is Enough</h3>
            <p><strong>💰 Save if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water in your region is soft</li>
                <li>Car stays in covered garage</li>
                <li>Limited budget (R$1,500-3,000)</li>
                <li>You don't mind reapplying in 3-5 years</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="article-tip">
                <h3>💡 Our Recommendation</h3>
                <p>For most people, quality traditional ceramic coating (Gtechniq, CarPro, Gyeon) offers 90% of the benefits for 50% of the price. Graphene is excellent, but not necessary for everyone.</p>

            <h2>Myths about graphene</h2>
            
            <h3>mYTH: "Graphene is indestructible"</h3>
            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> It's more resistant, but it's not magic. It still scratches with stones, branches, etc. It is no substitute for PPF for physical protection.</p>

            <h3>mYTH: "Any product with 'graphene' in the name is superior"</h3>
            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> Marketing! Many products have negligible amounts of graphene. Look for respected brands with proven tests.</p>

            <h3>mYTH: "Graphene eliminates the need to wash"</h3>
            <p><strong>TRUTH:</strong> It makes cleaning easier and repels dirt, but you still need to wash your car regularly.</p>

            <h3>tRUTH: "Graphene is better against water spots"</h3>
            <p>Yes, this is graphene's most notable and proven advantage over pure SiO2.</p>
