            <h2>What is Ceramic Coating?</h2>
            <p>Ceramic coating is a liquid protective layer based on nanotechnology which, when applied to paint, creates a permanent chemical bond with the surface. Unlike waxes and sealants, it is not removed by washing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Main benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protection against UV rays, oxidation and chemical contaminants</li>
                <li>Extreme hydrophobic effect (water runs off easily)</li>
                <li>Lasts from 2 to 5 years (depending on the product)</li>
                <li>Easy cleaning and maintenance</li>
                <li>Deep, long-lasting shine</li>
                <li>Resistance to light scratches</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <div class="article-warning">
                <h3>⚠️ ATTENTION: Don't Skip This Part</h3>
                <p>Ceramic coating does NOT correct defects. It seals the surface as it is. If you apply it to paint with scratches, you will permanently seal the scratches. Preparation is 80% of the job!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ideal application conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 15°C to 25°C</li>
                <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> 40% to 70%</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Closed garage, dust-free</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Bright light to see the application</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> Allow 4-6 hours without interruption</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Complete Step-by-Step</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Deep Wash (1-2 hours)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the car using the two bucket method</li>
                <li>Apply ferrous decontaminant to all paintwork</li>
                <li>Wait 5 minutes (it will turn purple where there is contamination)</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly</li>
                <li>Use clay bar on entire surface to remove contaminants</li>
                <li>Rinse again and dry completely</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="article-tip">
                <h3>💡 Plastic bag test</h3>
                <p>Run a plastic bag over the paint. If it feels rough, there are still contaminants. Continue with the clay bar until it is as smooth as glass.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Stage 2: Paint Correction (2-4 hours)</h3>
            <p>This is the most important and labor-intensive stage:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Use strong light to identify defects</li>
                <li><strong>Compound:</strong> Remove deep scratches with aggressive compound</li>
                <li><strong>Polish:</strong> Refine with fine polish to remove holograms</li>
                <li><strong>Check:</strong> Inspect under direct light</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don't have experience with polishing, consider hiring a professional for this step. A poorly applied coating can be removed, but a burnt paint job has no comeback.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Final preparation (30 minutes)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Clean all paintwork with IPA diluted 1:1</li>
                <li>Use a clean microfiber towel</li>
                <li>This removes oils, waxes and polish residue</li>
                <li>Leave to dry completely (10-15 minutes)</li>
                <li>Protect rubbers, plastics and glass with masking tape</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 4: Apply Ceramic Coating (1-2 hours)</h3>
            
            <div class="article-warning">
                <h3>⚠️ CRUCIAL: Work panel by panel</h3>
                <p>NEVER apply to the whole car at once. The coating cures quickly and can stain if you don't remove it in time.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Application technique:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place 3-5 drops of the coating on the applicator pad</li>
                <li>Apply in criss-cross movements (vertical + horizontal)</li>
                <li>Cover a small panel (e.g. half the hood)</li>
                <li>Wait for the "flash time" (30 seconds to 2 minutes - see instructions)</li>
                <li>The coating will start to "rainbow" when it's ready</li>
                <li>Remove with microfiber towel in straight movements</li>
                <li>Make a second pass with a clean towel to make sure</li>
                <li>Move on to next panel</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Recommended order of application</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Roof</li>
                <li>Hood (divide into 2-3 sections)</li>
                <li>Front fenders</li>
                <li>Doors (one at a time)</li>
                <li>Rear fenders</li>
                <li>Rear cover</li>
                <li>Bumpers</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 5: Initial cure (12-24 hours)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave the car in a covered, dry place</li>
                <li>DO NOT get wet for 24 hours</li>
                <li>DO NOT touch the paintwork</li>
                <li>Avoid dust and contaminants</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Applying to dirty/contaminated paint</strong> - will seal in dirt</li>

                <li><strong>Don't remove at the right time</strong> - Permanent stains</li>
                <li><strong>Apply in sun or heat</strong> - Cures too quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Use the wrong products during maintenance</strong> - Degrades the coating</li>
                <li><strong>Wetting before 24 hours</strong> - Compromises durability</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>Ceramic coating is the best investment in automotive protection, but it requires meticulous preparation. The difference between a professional result and a disaster is in the details.</p>
            
            <p>If you decide to do it yourself, take your time. It's better to take 2 days to do it right than to have to remove and redo it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The preparation is more important than the product. A well applied cheap coating outweighs a badly applied expensive coating.</p>
